Project Overview: Large-Scale Web Scraping of Google Business Listings

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to gather millions of business records from Google Business Listings for companies selling different products across various pin codes. The input for this task consists of a list of targeted products and pin codes, and the output will be a comprehensive dataset of business information, structured and ready for analysis.

Challenges Faced - During the execution of this project, we encountered several challenges that needed innovative solutions:

1) Given that almost every business is registered on Google Business Listing, the number of records retrieved for each keyword can easily exceed thousands. With over a thousand keywords and pin codes, the scale of this project grew to millions of records, transforming it into a Big Data challenge.
2) After running the scraper for some time, Google enforces Captcha verification as an anti-scraping measure, which disrupts the data extraction process.
3) Extracting granular details such as website URLs, email addresses, and phone numbers was problematic as many businesses did not have all these details available. This caused potential script failures.
4) Due to multiple keywords targeting the same businesses, duplicate entries for companies were a common occurrence. This required additional processing to ensure the data’s quality.

Solutions Implemented - To overcome the challenges, we employed the following strategies:

1) We developed a robust script capable of running continuously for extended hours without human intervention. The script is optimized to handle large-scale data extraction efficiently, ensuring smooth processing despite the volume.
2) We implemented advanced Computer Vision techniques to handle Captcha verification automatically. This allowed the script to continue extracting data without frequent manual interruptions, bypassing anti-bot detection effectively.
3) Our script was designed to be fully error-tolerant. It seamlessly handled missing or incomplete data without breaking the extraction process, ensuring that all available data was captured while avoiding disruptions due to anomalies.
4) We employed NLP-based data cleaning techniques to identify and remove redundant entries, ensuring that the final dataset contained high-quality, unique records only. This helped deliver clean, accurate data to the client.

Output Schema: The final dataset includes the following fields:

Serial Number – Unique identifier for each record.
Keyword – The product keyword used to search for the business.
Storefront Link – The URL to the business's Google Business listing.
Company Name – Name of the business.
Address – Full business address.
State – State where the business is located.
City – City where the business is located.
Pincode – Postal code of the business location.
Phone – Contact phone number of the business (if available).
Email ID – Contact email address of the business (if available).
Website – Website URL of the business (if available).
Rating – Google Business rating of the company.
Total Reviews – Number of reviews the company has received on Google Business.
Product 1 to Product 6 – List of up to 6 products that the business offers.

Conclusion:
This project delivers a scalable and reliable web scraping solution to gather detailed business information from Google Business Listings. The combination of automated data extraction, error-tolerant design, Captcha handling, and NLP-based data cleaning ensures that the client receives a comprehensive and high-quality dataset of businesses relevant to their needs.
